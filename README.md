# Ukraine is Forever

This is a project to try to get some lyrics I wrote for a pro-Ukraine song turned into an actual song. For that to happen I need to find someone who can write music/play an instrument. I figured I could find someone on the internet, so I needed a website.

The site: [ukraineisforever.org](https://ukraineisforever.org).

This site itself was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) based on a template provided by the host, [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). Any credit for how professional it looks belongs to the original developers; any blame for how amateurish it looks belongs to me, [Robert Austin](https://robert.grumbly.games/).
