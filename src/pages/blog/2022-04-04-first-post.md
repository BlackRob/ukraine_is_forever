Wow! A new website! How exciting. I'd celebrate, but women and children are being murdered in Ukraine right now. It doesn't feel like a time to celebrate.

## What to expect

As this site fills out, and _content_ is found or created, posts should mainly be sharing video and audio of people singing their version of "Ukraine is Forever". Sheet music, when people submit it. But sometimes there might be news about the site itself, or something joyful. Because even in times like this, you have to remember there are things to smile about. Like this picture with the Ukrainian firefighters and a cat. Adorable.

Love and hugs, and "later gators".
